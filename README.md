# House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices based on real estate features.  
It covers the full workflow: **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling outliers, feature scaling, PCA, model training, and hyperparameter tuning**.  

The goal is to improve model accuracy by applying best practices in data cleaning and optimization.
